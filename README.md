# Pristine-Collaboration-based-Social-Activity-Facilitator-App
Pristine is an android app which provides a social platform to citizens of an area to report environmental or social issues in that area to bring them to urgent attention or spread awareness, The basic features of the application include a camera access so that the user can take pictures of whatever they think is causing an issue( for example a pile of waste outside society, potholes, heavy traffic etc) and the photographs would be uploaded along with the location of that user, and other users would be able to see the pictures along with the locations so that it is easier for them to navigate if its required, The application also has options of initiating a meeting or alerting other users about the issues faced by them. Candid users could also join in to resolve a social cause as they would be able to see all the picture activity that is happening in the application.
